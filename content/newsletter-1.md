This is a ![M](insignia.png){width=20}arkdown starter project that will help you get started with creating newsletter email templates from Markdown files in Maizzle.

It supports all the framework features you already know and love:

- Tailwind CSS
- components
- expressions
- conditionals, loops etc.

## Ordered lists

1. _Italics_
2. **Bold text**
3. [Links](https://maizzle.com)

***

## Components

You can import Maizzle components right into your Markdown files. For example, the following button is a component:

<x-button href="https://maizzle.com/guides/markdown-emails" class="mb-8">
  Read the guide &rarr;
</x-button>

That's the `x-button` component, defined in `components/button.html`

***

## Styling

The starter includes CSS styles for common elements like paragraphs, headings, links, images, lists, <code>inline code</code>, or blockquotes:

> One small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.

It even supports code blocks:

```html
<p class="text-lg">
  <a href="https://maizzle.com">Maizzle</a> is a framework for building responsive HTML emails with Tailwind CSS.
</p>
```
